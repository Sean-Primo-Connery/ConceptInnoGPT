## Preparation

1. Due to the file size limitations on GitHub, you need to download the data from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10IR0MYWtlYs8dIo_vx45q1O-OPMUo439?usp=share_link) and store it in the "data" folder
2. Log in using the username "username" and the password "password"
3. We provide an API key (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) for testing purposes; however, its long-term validity is not guaranteed

## Essential settings

- Click the `Set` button
- Input your API Key and Base URL (If you use the provided API key, the default Base URL will suffice)
- Click the `Test and Save` button to validate your API Key
- Click the `Close` button to close the setting page

## Notice

- Please refrain from adjusting parameters during program execution
- The program's runtime is influenced by the response speed of OpenAI's API
- Refreshing the page will result in the loss of all data
- The system operates in a lazy mode, loading data only when necessaryâ€”that is, the first time the data is required. Consequently, the initial execution is relatively slow
